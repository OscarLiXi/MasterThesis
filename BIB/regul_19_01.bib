abstract = {This paper presents a fast and efficient computational approach to higher order spectral graph matching. Exploiting the redundancy in a tensor representing the affinity between feature points, we approximate the affinity tensor with the linear combination of Kronecker products between bases and index tensors. The bases and index tensors are highly compressed representations of the approximated affinity tensor, requiring much smaller memory than in previous methods, which store the full affinity tensor. We compute the principal eigenvector of the approximated affinity tensor using the small bases and index tensors without explicitly storing the approximated tensor. To compensate for the loss of matching accuracy by the approximation, we also adopt and incorporate a marginalization scheme that maps a higher order tensor to matrix as well as a one-to-one mapping constraint into the eigenvector computation process. The experimental results show that the proposed method is faster and requires smaller memory than the existing methods with little or no loss of accuracy.},

abstract = {Feature matching is a challenging problem at the heart of numerous computer graphics and computer vision applications. We present the SuperMatching algorithm for finding correspondences between two sets of features. It does so by considering triples or higher order tuples of points, going beyond the pointwise and pairwise approaches typically used. SuperMatching is formulated using a supersymmetric tensor representing an affinity metric that takes into account feature similarity and geometric constraints between features: Feature matching is cast as a higher order graph matching problem. SuperMatching takes advantage of supersymmetry to devise an efficient sampling strategy to estimate the affinity tensor, as well as to store the estimated tensor compactly. Matching is performed by an efficient higher order power iteration approach that takes advantage of this compact representation. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SuperMatching provides more accurate feature matching than other state-of-the-art approaches for a wide range of 2D and 3D features, with competitive computational cost.},

abstract = {We present a computational approach to high-order matching of data sets in IR(d). Those are matchings based on data affinity measures that score the matching of more than two pairs of points at a time. High-order affinities are represented by tensors and the matching is then given by a rank-one approximation of the affinity tensor and a corresponding discretization. Our approach is rigorously justified by extending Zass and Shashua's hypergraph matching to high-order spectral matching. This paves the way for a computationally efficient dual-marginalization spectral matching scheme. We also show that, based on the spectral properties of random matrices, affinity tensors can be randomly sparsified while retaining the matching accuracy. Our contributions are experimentally validated by applying them to synthetic as well as real data sets.},

@article{Kofidis2002,
abstract = {Abstract. Recently the problem of determining the best, in the least-squares sense, rank-1 approximation to a higher-order tensor was studied and an iterative method that extends the wellknown power method for matriceswasproposed for itssolution. Thishigher-order power method is also proposed for the special but important class of supersymmetric tensors, with no change. A simplified version, adapted to the special structure of the supersymmetric problem, is deemed unreliable, asitsconvergence isnot guaranteed. The aim of thispaper isto show that a symmetric version of the above method converges under assumptions of convexity (or concavity) for the functional induced by the tensor in question, assumptions that are very often satisfied in practical applications. The use of this version entails significant savings in computational complexity as compared to the unconstrained higher-order power method. Furthermore, a novel method for initializing the iterative processisdeveloped which hasbeen observed to yield an estimate that liescloser to the global optimum than the initialization suggested before. Moreover, its proximity to the global optimum is a priori quantifiable. In the course of the analysis, some important properties that the supersymmetry of a tensor implies for its square matrix unfolding are also studied.},

@article{Qi2005,
abstract = {In this paper, we define the symmetric hyperdeterminant, eigenvalues and E-eigenvalues of a real supersymmetric tensor. We show that eigenvalues are roots of a one-dimensional polynomial, and when the order of the tensor is even, E-eigenvalues are roots of another one-dimensional polynomial. These two one-dimensional polynomials are associated with the symmetric hyperdeterminant. We call them the characteristic polynomial and the E-characteristic polynomial of that supersymmetric tensor. Real eigenvalues (E-eigenvalues) with real eigenvectors (E-eigenvectors) are called H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues). When the order of the supersymmetric tensor is even, H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues) exist and the supersymmetric tensor is positive definite if and only if all of its H-eigenvalues (Z-eigenvalues) are positive. An m th -order n-dimensional supersymmetric tensor where m is even has exactly n(m - 1)n-1 eigenvalues, and the number of its E-eigenvalues is strictly less than n(m - 1)n-1 when m ≥ 4. We show that the product of all the eigenvalues is equal to the value of the symmetric hyperdeterminant, while the sum of all the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the diagonal elements of that supersymmetric tensor, multiplied by (m - 1)n-1. The n(m - 1)n-1 eigenvalues are distributed in n disks in C. The centers and radii of these n disks are the diagonal elements, and the sums of the absolute values of the corresponding off-diagonal elements, of that supersymmetric tensor. On the other hand, E-eigenvalues are invariant under orthogonal transformations. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
