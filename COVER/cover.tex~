% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract

\section*{Acknowledgments}
First of all, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Matthias Hein for giving me the opportunity to work on this exciting project.
His advices and scientific experience helped me to shape out my thesis.
He also showed me how a good research should work.
Under his supervision, I have not only learned a lot but also grown as a researcher.
I would like to thank him even more for his valuable help in one of the most difficult situations in my life.

I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Joachim Weickert for agreeing to review my master thesis 
and for initiating an excellent Visual Computing Program at Saarland University.
His lectures on Image Processing and Computer Vision has improved my general knowledge a lot and 
made me quickly become interested in the field, in particular in computer vision, 
which has positively influenced my work in this thesis in some specific way.

I am also thankful to Antoine Gautier for being my advisor. 
He dedicated a lot of time to reading and giving feedback to many of my reports as well as proof reading of this thesis.
I will not forget all the useful discussions that we had in various contexts.
Thanks also go to Francesco Tudisco for our useful discussions on the convexity of polynomial
and for joining me all the times for relaxing outside activities.

I thank all the members of the Machine Learning group -- Dagmar Glaser, Thomas Buehler, 
Antoine Gautier, Moritz Gerlach, Pratik Jawanpuria, Syama Sundar Rangapuram, Francesco Tudisco, Vikram Tankasali -- for the friendly environment, 
motivation and positive influence on my knowledge of machine learning, optimization and general mathematics.
I am thankful to Syama and Thomas for their help in some technical problems that I encountered at the early stage of my thesis.

I would like to thank the International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science for giving me the opportunity to study at Saarland University.
I am deeply grateful to the constant support from Jennifer Gerling and Stephanie J\"org during all the time of my studies. 

Last but not least, special thanks I want to give to my family for their unlimited love, support and encouragement 
regardless of thousands of kilometers that separated us.
