   Graph matching is a core problem of computer vision and pattern recognition.
   The corresponding quadratic assignment problem is NP-hard and, in the past, several
   methods have been developed for the second-order case. In recent years also third-order
   approaches became popular as they allow for better integration of geometric information.
   For most of these higher-order algorithms no theoretical guarantees are known. 
   In this thesis we propose a general framework for tensor block coordinate ascent methods for third-order graph matching. 
   We first formulate the problem as maximization of a third-order polynomial function with respect to assignment constraints.
   Then, we prove the equivalence between the optimization of the original function and the optimization of its associated multilinear form
   over any constraint set by extending one result from the matrix case.
   Based on this, we propose two new algorithms which both come along with the guarantee of monotonic ascent in the objective on
   the set of discrete assignment matrices. 
   In the experiments, we show that our algorithms outperform previous work both in terms of achieving better objective values and in terms
   of matching accuracy. 
   This holds in particular for very challenging settings where one has a high number of outliers and other form of noise.
